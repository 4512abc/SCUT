/**
 * A nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA) is a 5-tuple (S,∑,F,s0,sf). Here,
 *   S - a finite set of state. i.e The vertex set of transition graph of NFA
 *   ∑ - an Alphabet, not including ε
 *   F - S X ∑ U {ε} -> subset of S
 *   s0 - a start state
 *   sf - an accepting state.
 * Here, following McNaughton-Yamada-Thompson algorithm, NFA has the following properties:
 *   each NFA has only one accepting state;
 *   The accepting state has no outgoing transitions, and the start state has no incoming
 *   transitions.
 *   Each state other than the accepting state has either one outgoing transition on a symbol
 *   in alphabet or two outgoing transitions, both on ε(epsilon).
