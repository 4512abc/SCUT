## 二、简答题 

### What is the difference between the DMA and interrupt-driven methods？（from two ways to analyze: (1) What time should CPU response DMA request or interrupt request? (2) Which work should CPU need to do when it acknowledges DMA request or interrupt request?）

**Solution:**

**(1) CPU响应时间的差异**

 **DMA（直接内存访问）方法**

- DMA请求通常在外部设备准备好进行批量数据传输时发出。例如，当硬盘控制器准备好将一批数据写入内存，或者从内存读取一批数据时，就会向CPU发出DMA请求。

- CPU响应DMA请求的时机相对灵活。它可以在当前机器周期完成后，将系统总线的控制权交给DMA控制器。在整个数据传输过程中，CPU不需要逐字节地参与数据传输，只要在传输开始和结束阶段进行一些必要的协调。

- 例如，在数据传输期间，CPU可以去执行其他与该数据传输不冲突的任务，如进行内部运算、处理其他设备的一些简单请求等。

- **中断驱动方法**

- 中断请求是在外部设备完成某个特定操作或者出现需要CPU立即处理的事件时发出。比如，当打印机打印完一行字符，或者键盘有按键按下时，相应的设备就会发出中断请求。

- CPU必须在当前指令执行完毕后，立即检查是否有中断请求。如果有中断请求且满足响应条件（如中断优先级高于当前任务的优先级等），CPU就会暂停当前程序的执行，转而处理中断。这种响应是比较及时的，因为中断往往代表着一些需要紧急处理的事件，如实时性要求较高的设备输入输出操作。

**(2) CPU确认请求后的工作差异**

- **DMA（直接内存访问）方法**

- 当CPU确认DMA请求后，它主要做的工作是将系统总线的控制权交给DMA控制器。这包括让出数据总线、地址总线和控制总线的控制权。

- CPU然后可以继续执行其他任务，只要这些任务不涉及正在被DMA传输操作的内存区域和相关的I/O设备。例如，在DMA传输期间，CPU可以执行一些内部的数据处理任务，或者对其他未参与DMA传输的设备进行简单的管理操作。

- 当DMA传输完成后，DMA控制器会向CPU发出一个传输完成的信号，CPU这时可能需要对传输结果进行一些后续处理，比如检查数据传输是否正确等。

- **中断驱动方法**

- CPU在确认中断请求后，首先要保存当前程序的上下文，包括程序计数器（PC）的值、各个寄存器的内容等。这些信息被保存到特定的栈或者内存区域，以便在中断处理完成后能够恢复原来程序的执行。

- 然后，CPU根据中断源确定要执行的中断服务程序（ISR）。中断服务程序是专门用于处理该中断事件的一段程序代码。例如，对于键盘中断，中断服务程序可能会读取键盘缓冲区中的按键码，并将其转换为对应的字符或命令，然后进行相应的处理，如将字符显示在屏幕上或者将命令传递给应用程序。

- 在执行完中断服务程序后，CPU要恢复之前保存的程序上下文，然后继续执行被中断的程序，就好像中断没有发生过一样。

 

 

 

### A set-associative cache consists of a total 32 blocks divided into 4-block sets. The main memory contains 1024 blocks, each consisting of 64 words.

### (1)How many bits are there in a main memory address?

### (2)How many bits are there in each of the TAG, SET, and WORD fields?

**Solution:**

假设字长是16位：

$$
1024 * 64 * 16 = 1Gb
$$

$$
Word：log_264 = 6 \\

Set：log_28 = 3 \\

16 – 3 – 6 = 7
$$



 

 



### The two unsigned binary numbers shown below are to be multiplied using a multiplier that uses Booth’s Algorithm:

```assembly
   1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0
X  0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1
```

### (1) How many bits will be needed to store the product of these two numbers?

### (2) How many additions and subtractions will be performed by the Booth’s Algorithm multiplier respectively?

**Solution:**

$2 \times 8 = 16 bit$

使用布斯算法：

```
01110111 0 = +1 0 0 -1 +1 0 0 -1 
```

 所以需要两次加法和两次减法。

 

 

## 三、综合题

Suppose the designers need two-address instructions, one-address instructions and zero-address instructions. How should we design the instruction format? And specify the numbers of each type of instruction can be designed.

**Solution:**

  | ------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
  | 0000 - 1110   | 000000 - 111111 | 000000 - 111111 |

- 一地址：最低6位用于操作数，最高4位全为1，中间6位用于实现操作码。一共$2^{6}-1 = 63$种

  | 最高4位 | 操作码（6位）   | 操作数（6位）   |
  | ------- | --------------- | --------------- |
  | 1111    | 000000 - 111110 | 000000 - 111111 |

- 零地址：最低6位表示操作码，其余全部填充为1。一共$2^6=64$种

  | 最高4位 | 6位    | 操作码（6位）   |
  | ------- | ------ | --------------- |
  | 1111    | 111111 | 000000 - 111111 |
