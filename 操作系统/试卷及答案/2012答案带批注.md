#### **The operating system is not responsible for the following activities in connection with process management?  D**

A.   Suspending[暂停]  and resuming[恢复] processes   

B.   Providing mechanism for process synchronization

C.   Handling deadlock

D.   Keeping track of free memory



#### Which of the following process schedule algorithm can lead to starvation?  C

A. FCFS       B. Round Robin     C. SJF     D. Guaranteed Scheduling

保证调度[Guaranteed Scheduling]

一种完全不同的调度算法是向用户作出明确的性能保证，然后去实现它。一种很实际并很容易实现的保证是：若用户工作时有n个用户登录，则用户将获得CPU处理能力的1/n。类似地，在一个有n个进程运行的单用户系统中，若所有的进程都等价，则每个进程将获得1/n的CPU时间

**List at least three key differences between user-level threads and kernel-level threads?**

**User-level thread**

Managed by application

Kernel not aware of thread

Context switching cheap

Create as many as needed

Must be used with care

**Kernel-level thread**

Managed by kernel

Consumes kernel resources

Context switching expensive 

Number limited by kernel resources

Simpler to use
