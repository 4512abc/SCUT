> Explanation: The project team must complete a scope statement for developing a common understanding of the project scope among stakeholders. This lists project deliverables - summary level sub-products, whose full and satisfactory delivery marks the completion of the project.
>
> Scope verification is the process of securing a formal acceptance of the project scope by stakeholders.
>
> Scope definition is the process of subdividing the major project deliverables into smaller, more manageable components.
>
> A risk management plan involves setting up processes for identifying and dealing with project risks.

126. **An organization is certified to a stringent environmental standard and uses that as the key differentiator with its competitors. Alternative identification during scope planning for a particular project has thrown up an expeditious approach to achieve a project need, but this involves a risk of environmental contamination. The team evaluates that the likelihood of the risk is very low. What should the project team do?**

     1.  Drop the alternative approach

     2.  Work out a mitigation plan

     3.  Procure an insurance against the risk

     4.  Plan all precautions to avoid the risk

> Answer: A
>
> Explanation: The organization's reputation being at stake, the threshold for such a risk would be very low.
>
> Mitigation plan against an environmental contamination would mean reducing the impact, which may not be a plausible response.
>
> Procuring an insurance against the risk would only transfer the monetary impact of the risk, and not the intangible impact like, the reputation of the organization.
>
> Planning precautions against the occurrence would still leave an opportunity of occurrence.
>
> This cannot be completely avoided.
>
> The best option would be to drop the approach - that is, complete avoidance of the risk.

127. **The following three tasks form the entire critical path of the project network. The three estimates of each of these tasks are tabulated below. How long would the project take to complete expressed with an accuracy of one standard deviation?**

|      |            |             |             |
|------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| Task | Optimistic | Most likely | Pessimistic |
| A    | 15         | 25          | 47          |
| B    | 12         | 22          | 35          |
| C    | 16         | 27          | 32          |

1.  75.5

2.  75.5 +/- 5.08

3.  75.5 +/- 8.5

4.  75.5 +/- 2.83

> Answer: B
>
> Explanation: The critical path is the longest duration path through a network and determines the shortest time to complete the project. The PERT estimates of the tasks listed are 27, 22.5 & 26. Therefore, the length of the critical path of the project is 27+22.5+26 = 75.5.
>
> The standard deviations of the estimates of the three tasks are determined as (P-O)/6 = 2, 3.83 & 2.67 respectively. The standard deviation of the total path is determined as Sq. root (sum of variances), where variance = square of standard deviation. Thus, standard deviation of critical path = Sq. root (4+14.67+7.13) = 5.08.

128. **After a study of the work processes on a project, a quality audit team reports to the project manager that irrelevant quality standards were being used by the project, which might lead to rework. What was the objective of the project manager in initiating this study?**

     2.  Quality planning

     3.  Checking adherence to processes

     4.  Quality assurance

> Answer: D
>
> Explanation: Determining validity of quality standards, followed by the project is a 'quality assurance' activity.
>
> Compliance of work results to required specifications is a 'quality control' activity.
>
> Determining quality standards is a 'quality planning' activity.
>
> 'Checking adherence to processes' is a quality audit activity to ensure that standard operating procedures or job instruction documents (SOPs or JIDs) are being followed for producing the deliverables of the process.

> Work authorization system is a tool used for orchestrating execution of various project tasks.
>
> Whereas, Corrective and Preventive actions are inputs to the project plan execution process from various controlling processes.

131. **A project manager would find team development the most difficult in which form of organization?**

     1.  Weak Matrix organization

     2.  Balanced Matrix organization

     3.  Projectized organization

     4.  Tight Matrix organization

> Answer: A
>
> Explanation: In a functional organization, the project team members have dual reporting to two bosses - the project manager and the functional manager.
>
> In a weak matrix organization, the power rests with the functional manager.
>
> In a balanced matrix organization, the power is shared between the functional manager and the project manager. A projectized organization is grouped by projects and the project manager has complete control on the project and its team.
>
> A Tight matrix organization refers to co-locating the project team and has nothing to do with a matrix organization.
>
> Therefore, a project manager would find it difficult to drive team development in a weak matrix organization.

132. **The project manager of a large multi-location software project team has 24 members, out of which 5 are assigned to testing. Due to recent recommendations by an organizational quality audit team, the project manager is convinced to add a quality professional to lead the test team at additional cost, to the project.**

>
> **How many additional communication channels are introduced as a result of this organizational change in the project?**

1.  25

2.  24

3.  1

4.  5

> Answer: A
>
> Explanation: Number of communication channels with "n" members = n\*(n-1)/2
>
> Originally the project has 25 members (including the project manager), which makes the total communication channels as 25\*24/2 = 300.
>
> With the addition of the quality professional as a member of the project team, the communication channels increase to 26\*25/2 = 325.
>
> Therefore, the additional channels as a result of the change, that is, 325-300 = 25.

     3.  Project is under budget and ahead of schedule

     4.  Project is over budget and ahead of schedule

> Answer: A
>
> Explanation: Positive Schedule Variance means the project is ahead of schedule; Negative Cost Variance means the project is over-budget.

136. **During execution of a project, an identified risk event occurs that results in additional cost and time. The project had provisions for contingency and management reserves. How should these be accounted for?**

     1.  Contingency reserves

     2.  Residual risks

     3.  Management reserves

     4.  Secondary risks

> Answer: A
>
> Explanation: The question is about correct accounting for risk events that occur and updating the reserves.
>
> Reserves are meant for making provisions in cost and schedule, to accommodate for consequences of risk events.
>
> Risk events are classified as "unknown unknowns" or "known unknowns", where "unknown unknowns" are risks that were are not identified and accounted for, while "known unknowns" are risks that were identified and provisions were made for them.
>
> Provisions for "unknown unknowns" are in management reserves while those for "known unknowns" are accommodated in contingency reserves. Management reserves are at the discretion of senior management while the contingency reserves are at the project manager's discretion.
>
> Residual and secondary risks are remaining unmitigated risks and resultant risks of mitigation, respectively. These are not reserves.
>
> In this case, the risk event is one of the identified risks and therefore, 'contingency reserve' is the one where the cost and schedule impact would be accommodated in.

137. **Which one of the following is the last step of project closing?**

     1.  Client has accepted the product

138. **Who should be involved in the creation of lessons learned, at closure of a project?**

     1.  Stakeholders

     2.  Project team

     3.  Management of the performing organization

     4.  Project office

> Answer: A
>
> Explanation: 'Stakeholders' include everyone who are actively involved in the project or whose interests may be affected as a result of the project execution or completion.
>
> The 'project team' creates the lessons learned on the project.
>
> The role of the 'project office' depends on the function defined for it within the performing organization and it could be either facilitating best practices for all projects or could constitute the project team.
>
> As lessons learned should capture all variations and what could have been done better for future deployment, 'stakeholders' should be involved in creation of lessons learned.

139. **An organization has recently started outsourcing work to a low cost, high value, engineering center located in a different country.**

> **Which of the following should the project manager provide for the team as a proactive measure?**

1.  A training course on the laws of the country

2.  A course on linguistic differences

3.  An exposure to the cultural differences

4.  A communication management plan

> Answer: C
>
> Explanation: Understanding cultural differences is the first step towards an effective communication amongst the project team involving outsourced work from a different country. So, what is needed in this case is 'an exposure to the cultural differences', which is being mentioned as choice C.
>
> Choice A, that is, 'a training course on the laws of the country' is a subject of legal experts and not of the project team.
>
> Choice B, that is, ' a course on linguistic differences' would not serve the purpose of understanding and appreciating cultural differences, for better teaming.
>
> Choice D, that is, 'a communication management plan' is a document that provides data gathering and dissemination amongst stakeholders of the project. It is necessary for the project but does not help in bridging communication gaps across different cultures

1.  Report the error and the expected delay

2.  Omit the status update on the milestone

3.  Report the error and the planned recovery actions

4.  Assess alternatives to meet the milestone

> Answer: D
>
> Explanation: Choice D, that is, 'assess alternatives to meet the milestone' indicates confronting the issue with an attempt to resolve the issue. Hence this would be the best approach.
>
> Choices A and C, that is, 'report the error and the expected delay' or 'report the error and the planned recovery actions' do not attempt to solve the problem.
>
> An attempt to solve the problem is the next best thing to do in this situation, before reporting the issue correctly.
>
> Choice B, that is, 'omit the status update on the milestone' is unethical.
