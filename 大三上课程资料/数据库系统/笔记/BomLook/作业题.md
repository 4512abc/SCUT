10.17 List two advantages and two disadvantages of each of the following strategies
for storing a relational database:
a. Store each relation in one file.
b. Store multiple relations (perhaps even the entire database) in one
file.
Answer:
a. Advantages of storing a relation as a file include using the file system
provided by the OS , thus simplifying the DBMS, but incurs
the disadvantage of restricting the ability of the DBMS to increase
performance by using more sophisticated storage structures.

b. By using one file for the entire database, these complex structures
can be implemented through the DBMS, but this increases the size
and complexity of the DBMS.
