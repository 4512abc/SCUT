<H2>Step5: Banking project-Create Subclasses of Bank Accounts</H2>
</CENTER>


<H3>Objective</H3>

<P>
In this lab you will create two subclasses of the <TT>Account</TT> class
in the Banking project: <TT>SavingsAccount</TT> and <TT>CheckingAccount</TT>.
You will override the <TT>withdraw</TT> method for checking accounts and use
<TT>super</TT> to invoke a parent constructor.
</P>


<H3>Directions</H3>

<P>
Start by changing your working directory to <TT>/step5</TT> on your computer.
</P>

<H4>Implementing the Account Subclasses</H4>

<CENTER> <IMG SRC="UML.gif" ALT="The UML Diagram of the Account Subclasses" BORDER=0> </CENTER>

<P>
To the <TT>banking</TT> package, you will add the <TT>SavingsAccount</TT>
and <TT>CheckingAccount</TT> subclasses as modeled by the UML diagram above.
</P>

<OL>

  <LI>Create the <TT>banking</TT> directory.  Copy the previous Banking project
      files in this package directory.
      <P>

  <H5>Modify the Account Class</H5>

  <LI>In the UML diagram the <TT>Account</TT> class has changed: The <TT>balance</TT>
      attribute is now <I>protected</I> (indicated by the <TT>#</TT> character
      instead of the <TT>-</TT> character).
     <P>

  <LI>Change the access mode of the <TT>balance</TT> attribute to <TT>protected</TT>.
     <P>

  <H5>The Savings Account Subclass</H5>

  <LI>Implement the <TT>SavingsAccount</TT> class as modeled in the above
     UML diagram.  
     <P>

  <LI>The <TT>SavingsAccount</TT> class must extend the <TT>Account</TT> class.
     
     <P>

  <LI>It must include an <TT>interestRate</TT> attribute with type <TT>double</TT>.
     
     <P>

  <LI>It must include a public constructor that takes two parameters:
     <TT>balance</TT> and <TT>interest_rate</TT>.  This constructor must
     pass the <TT>balance</TT> parameter to the parent constructor by calling
     <TT>super(balance)</TT>.
     <P>

  <H5>The Checking Account Subclass</H5>

  <LI>Implement the <TT>CheckingAccount</TT> class as modeled in the above
     UML diagram.  
     <P>

  <LI>The <TT>CheckingAccount</TT> class must extend the <TT>Account</TT> class.
     
     <P>

  <LI>It must include an <TT>overdraftProtection</TT> attribute with type <TT>double</TT>.
      <P>

  <LI>It must include one public constructor that takes one parameter:
     <TT>balance</TT>.  This constructor must
     pass the <TT>balance</TT> parameter to the parent constructor by calling
     <TT>super(balance)</TT>.
     <P>

  <LI>It must include another public constructor that takes two parameters:
     <TT>balance</TT> and <TT>protect</TT>.  This constructor must
     pass the <TT>balance</TT> parameter to the parent constructor by calling
     <TT>super(balance)</TT> and set the <TT>overdraftProtection</TT> attribute.
     <P>

  <LI>The <TT>CheckingAccount</TT> class must override the <TT>withdraw</TT>
      method.  It must it perform the following check: if the current balance
      is adequate to cover the <TT>amount</TT> to withdraw, then proceed as
      usual. If not <EM>and if there is overdraft protection</EM>, then
      attempt to cover the difference (<TT>balance</TT> - <TT>amount</TT>)
      by value of the <TT>overdraftProtection</TT>.  If the amount needed
      to cover the overdraft is greater than the current level of protection,
      then the whole transaction must fail with the checking balance unaffected.
      <P>
      	
     <LI>It must include one public method  <TT>getOverdraftProtection</TT> that return value of the <TT>overdraftProtection</TT>.
     <P>

In the main <TT>step5</TT> directory, compile and execute the
<TT>TestBanking</TT> program.  The output should be:

<PRE>
Creating the customer Jane Smith.
Creating her Savings Account with a 500.00 balance and 3% interest.
Creating the customer Owen Bryant.
Creating his Checking Account with a 500.00 balance and no overdraft protection.
Creating the customer Tim Soley.
Creating his Checking Account with a 500.00 balance and 500.00 in overdraft protection.
Creating the customer Maria Soley.
Maria shares her Checking Account with her husband Tim.

Retrieving the customer Jane Smith with her savings account.
Withdraw 150.00: true
Deposit 22.50: true
Withdraw 47.62: true
Withdraw 400.00: false
Customer [Simms, Jane] has a balance of 324.88

Retrieving the customer Owen Bryant with his checking account with no overdraft protection.
Withdraw 150.00: true
Deposit 22.50: true
Withdraw 47.62: true
Withdraw 400.00: false
Customer [Bryant, Owen] has a balance of 324.88

Retrieving the customer Tim Soley with his checking account that has overdraft protection.
Withdraw 150.00: true
Deposit 22.50: true
Withdraw 47.62: true
Withdraw 400.00: true
Now the overdraft protection of checking account is ###.##(print the actual value here)
Customer [Soley, Tim] has a balance of 0.0

Retrieving the customer Maria Soley with her joint checking account with husband Tim.
Deposit 150.00: true
Withdraw 750.00: false
Customer [Soley, Maria] has a balance of 150.0
</PRE>
</OL>
Notice that Jane's savings account and Owen's checking account fundamentaly
behave as a plain-old bank account.  But Tim & Maria's joint checking account
has 500.00 worth of overdraft protection.  Tim's transactions dip into that
protection and therefore his ending balance is 0.00.  His account's overdraft
protection level is 424.88.  Finally, Maria deposits 150.00 into this joint
account; raising the balance from 0.00 to 150.00.  Then she tries withdraw
1000.00, which fails because neither the balance nor the overdraft protection
can cover that requested amount.
