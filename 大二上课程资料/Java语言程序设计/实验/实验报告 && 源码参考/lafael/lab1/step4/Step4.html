<H2>Step4: Banking project-Use Arrays to Represent Associations</H2>
</CENTER>


<H3>Objective</H3>

<P>
In this lab you will use arrays to implement the multiplicity on the
association between a bank and its customers.
</P>

<H3>Directions</H3>

<P>
To the <TT>banking</TT> package, you will add the <TT>Bank</TT> class as
modeled by the UML diagram above.  A bank object simply keeps track of an
association between itself and its customers.  We will implement this
aggregate association with an array of <TT>Customer</TT> objects.  We will
also need to keep a integer attribute that keeps track of how many customers
currently exist in the bank.
</P>

<TT></TT>

<OL>

  <LI>Create the <TT>banking</TT> directory.  Copy the previous Banking project
      files in this package directory.
      <P>

  <LI>Add two attributes to the <TT>Bank</TT> class: <TT>customers</TT>
      (an array of <TT>Customer</TT> objects) and <TT>numberOfCustomers</TT>
      (an integer that keeps track of the next <TT>customers</TT> array index).
      </P>

  <LI>Add a public constructor that initializes the <TT>customers</TT> array
      with some appropriate maximum size (at least bigger than 5).
      </P>

  <LI>Add the <TT>addCustomer</TT> method.  This method must construct a new
      <TT>Customer</TT> object from the parameters (first name, last name)
      and place it on the <TT>customers</TT> array.  It
      must also increment the <TT>numberOfCustomers</TT> attribute.
      </P>

  <LI>Add the <TT>getNumOfCustomers</TT> accessor method, which returns
      the <TT>numberOfCustomers</TT> attribute.
      </P>

  <LI>Add the <TT>getCustomer</TT> method.  This method returns the customer
      associated with the given <TT>index</TT> parameter.
      </P>
</OL>
      
<H3>Testing</H3>
<p>
<OL>Compile and run the <TT>TestBanking</TT> program.
      You shoud see the following output:
<PRE>
Customer [1] is Simms, Jane
Customer [2] is Bryant, Owen
Customer [3] is Soley, Tim
Customer [4] is Soley, Maria
</PRE>
