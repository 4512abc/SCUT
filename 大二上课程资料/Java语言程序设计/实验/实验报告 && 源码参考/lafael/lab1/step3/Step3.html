<H3>Directions</H3>

<P>
Start by changing your working directory to <TT>/step3</TT> on your computer.

<OL>

  <LI>Create the <TT>banking</TT> directory.  Copy the previous Banking project
      files in this package directory.
      <P>

  <LI>Modify the <TT>Account</TT> class to conditionalize the <TT>withdraw</TT>
      and <TT>deposit</TT> methods.
      <P>
	<OL>
	  <LI>Modify the <TT>deposit</TT> method to return <TT>true</TT>.
	      (meaning all deposits are successful)
	  <LI>Modify the <TT>withdraw</TT> method to check that the amount
	      being withdrawn is not greater than the current balance.
	      If <TT>amt</TT> is less than <TT>balance</TT>, then subtract
	      the amount from the balance and return <TT>true</TT>; else,
	      leave the balance alone and return <TT>false</TT>.
	</OL>
