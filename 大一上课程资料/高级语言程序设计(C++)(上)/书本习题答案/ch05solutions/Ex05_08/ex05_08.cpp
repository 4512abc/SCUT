// Find the smallest of several integers.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std; 

int main()
{
   int number; // number of values
   int value; // current value
   int smallest; // smallest value so far

   cout << "Enter the number of integers to be processed ";

   cin >> number >> smallest;

   // loop (number -1) times
