// Exercise 6.21 Solution: Ex06_21.cpp
// Determine whether inputs are odd or even.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

bool isEven( int ); // function prototype

int main()
{
   int x; // current input
      
   // loop for 3 inputs
   for ( int i = 1; i <= 3; i++ ) 
   {
      cout << "Enter an integer: ";
      cin >> x;
   
      // determine if input is even
      if ( isEven( x ) )
         cout << x << " is an even integer\n\n";
      else
         cout << x << " is an odd integer\n\n";
   } // end for

   cout << endl;

// isEven returns true if a is even
