// Exercise 6.18 Solution: Ex06_18.cpp
// Calculate exponentiation of integers.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int integerPower( int, int ); // function prototype

int main()
{
   int exp; // integer exponent
   int base; // integer base

   cout << "Enter base and exponent: ";

   cout << base << " to the power " << exp << " is: "
      << integerPower( base, exp ) << endl;

// integerPower calculates and returns b raised to the e power

   // multiply product times b e number of times
   for ( int i = 1; i <= e; i++ )
      product *= b;
   
   return product; // return resulting product
