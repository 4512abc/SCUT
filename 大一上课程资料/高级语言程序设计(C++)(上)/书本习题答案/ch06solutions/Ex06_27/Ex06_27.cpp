// Exercise 6.27 Solution: Ex06_27.cpp
// Determine the smallest of 3 numbers.
#include <iostream> 
using namespace std;

double smallest( double, double, double ); // function prototype

int main()
{
   double x; // first input
   double y; // second input

   // determine smallest value

// smallest returns the smallest of a, b and c
