// Exercise 6.41 Solution: Ex06_41.cpp
// Recursive greatest common divisor.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

unsigned gcd( unsigned int, unsigned int ); // function prototype

int main()
{
   unsigned x; // first integer
   unsigned y; // second integer

   cout << "Enter two integers: ";
   cin >> x >> y;

   cout << "Greatest common divisor of " << x << " and "
      << y << " is " << gcd( x, y ) << endl;

// gcd recursively finds greatest common divisor of a and b
