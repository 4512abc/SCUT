// Exercise 6.31 Solution: Ex06_31.cpp
// Finds greatest common divisor (GCD) of 2 inputs.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int gcd( int, int ); // function prototype

int main()
{
   int a; // first number
   int b; // second number

   // loop for 5 pairs of inputs
   for ( int j = 1; j <= 5; j++ ) 
   {
      cout << "Enter two integers: ";
      cin >> a >> b;

      cout << "The greatest common divisor of " 
         << a << " and " << b << " is ";

      // find greatest common divisor of a and b
      cout <<  gcd( a, b ) << endl;
   } // end for
} // end main

// gcd finds greatest common divisor of x and y
int gcd( int x, int y )
{
   int greatest = 1; // current greatest common divisor, 1 is minimum

   // loop from 2 to smaller of x and y
   for ( int i = 2; i <= ( ( x < y ) ? x: y ); i++ )
   {
      // if current i divides both x and y
      if ( x % i == 0 && y % i == 0 )
         greatest = i; // update greatest common divisor
   } // end for

   return greatest; // return greatest common divisor found
} // end function gcd
