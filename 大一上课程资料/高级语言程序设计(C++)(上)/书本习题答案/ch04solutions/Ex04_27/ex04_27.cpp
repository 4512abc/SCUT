// Convert a binary value to its decimal equivalent.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std; 

int main()
{
   int binary; // binary value
   int bit = 1; // bit positional value
   int decimal = 0; // decimal value

   // prompt for and read in a binary number
   cout << "Enter a binary number: ";
   cin >> binary;

   // convert to decimal equivalent
   while ( binary != 0 )

      decimal += binary % 10 * bit;
      binary /= 10;
      bit *= 2;
   } // end while loop

   cout << "Decimal is: " << decimal << endl;
} // end main
