// Exercise 4.30 Solution: ex04_30.cpp
// Calculate the diameter, circumference and area of a cirle.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std; 

int main()
{
   double radius; // input radius 
   double pi = 3.14159; // value for pi

   // get radius value
   cout << "Enter the radius: ";
   cin >> radius;

   // compute and display diameter
   cout << "The diameter is " << radius * 2.0;

   // compute and display circumference 
   cout << "\nThe circumference is " << 2.0 * pi * radius;

   // compute and display area
   cout << "\nThe area is " << pi * radius * radius << endl;
} // end main
