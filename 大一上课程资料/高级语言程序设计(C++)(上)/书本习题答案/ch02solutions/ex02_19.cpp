#include <iostream> // allows program to perform input and output

   int number2; // second integer read from user
   int number3; // third integer read from user
   int smallest; // smallest integer read from user
   int largest; // largest integer read from user

   cout << "Input three different integers: "; // prompt

   largest = number1; // assume first integer is largest

   if ( number2 > largest ) // is number2 larger?

   if ( number3 > largest ) // is number3 larger?
      largest = number3; // number3 is now the largest
