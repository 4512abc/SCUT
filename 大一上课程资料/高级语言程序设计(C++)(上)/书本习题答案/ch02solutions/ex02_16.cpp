// Exercise 2.16 Solution: ex02_16.cpp
#include <iostream> // allows program to perform input and output
using namespace std; // program uses names from the std namespace

int main()
{
   int number1; // first integer read from user 
   int number2; // second integer read from user  

   cout << "Enter two integers: "; // prompt user for data
   cin >> number1 >> number2; // read values from user

   // output the results
   cout << "The sum is " << number1 + number2 
      << "\nThe product is " << number1 * number2 
      << "\nThe difference is " << number1 - number2 
      << "\nThe quotient is " << number1 / number2 << endl;
} // end main
