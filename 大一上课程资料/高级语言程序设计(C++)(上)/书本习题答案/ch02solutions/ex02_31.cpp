#include <iostream> // allows program to perform input and output
using namespace std; // program uses names from the std namespace

int main()

   // variables to store statistics
   int miles, cost, mpg, parking, tolls;

   // prompt user for each variable and read it in
   cout << "Enter miles driven per day: ";

   cin >> mpg;
   cout << "Enter parking fees per day (in dollars): ";
   cin >> parking;

   cin >> tolls;

   // calculate their daily cost in dollars
   int total = miles * cost / mpg / 100 + parking + tolls;

   // display cost
