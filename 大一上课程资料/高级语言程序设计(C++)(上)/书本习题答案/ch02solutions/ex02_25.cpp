// Exercise 2.25 Solution: ex02_25.cpp
#include <iostream> // allows program to perform input and output
using namespace std; // program uses names from the std namespace

int main()
{
   int number1; // first integer read from user
   int number2; // second integer read from user

   cout << "Enter two integers: "; // prompt
   cin >> number1 >> number2; // read two integers from user

   // using modulus operator
   if ( number1 % number2 == 0 )
      cout << number1 << " is a multiple of " << number2 << endl;

   if ( number1 % number2 != 0 )
      cout << number1 << " is not a multiple of " << number2 << endl;
} // end main
