// Exercise 19.7 Solution: BucketSort.h
// Class BucketSort contains a vector of random integers and a function 
// that uses bucket sort to sort the integers.
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class BucketSort
{
public:
   BucketSort( int ); // constructor initializes vector
   void displayElements() const; // display vector elements
   void sort(); // perform a bucket sort on vector
private:
   int size; // vector size
   vector< int > data; // vector of ints
   vector< vector < int > > bucket; // two-dimensional vector of ints

   // utility functions used by member function bucketSort
   void distributeElements( int );
   void collectElements();
   int numberOfDigits();
   void zeroBucket();
}; // end class BucketSort
